/** Abstract Syntax Tree This object defines the model for processing RIDDL and
  * producing a raw AST from it. This raw AST has no referential integrity, it
  * just results from applying the parsing rules to the input. The RawAST models
  * produced from parsing are syntactically correct but have no semantic
  * validation. The Transformation passes convert RawAST model to AST model
  * which is referentially and semantically consistent (or the user gets an
  * error).
